# boaanagramtest

To run this application, run the following command from the project root directory and follow the instructions

sbt run src/main/scala/AnagramChecker.scala

To run the tests use the command from the root directory

sbt test

NOTE: When you run sbt run, its throwing an error relating to sbt assembly, I did not spend more time to fix that due to time constraints but the functionality is there with the tests.
